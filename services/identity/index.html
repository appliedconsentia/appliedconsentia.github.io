        <h1 class="title">Identity management</h1>
        <div class="content"><p>The identity of a person is the physical attributes and data, knowledge and experience accumulated over time. A person’s identity enables the person to differentiate from others.</p>

<p>When two or more parties transact with each other, the first step is to identify themselves. The parties to the transactions could share information about themselves. This scenario is not desirable. Malicious actors could use another identity to impersonate.</p>

<p>It is also insufficient for a party to believe another party’s assertion of their identity. Thus, a third and trusted party is typically needed to verify a given identity.</p>

<p>For business transactions, it is common to use credentials such as identity cards or digital identities (i.e. email addresses, unique alphanumeric names, etc.) to represent the identities of parties to the transactions.  The issuing and verification of credentials typically follow the process illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

    <figcaption>Figure 1: Veriable credentials [see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials]</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A trusted party is typically responsible for issuing credentials to a subject who controls access to the verifiable data registry. Thus, the subject and verifiers are at the mercy of the issuer. A malicious actor could easily exploit such an arrangement for bad intentions.</p>

<h2 id="decentralized-identifiers">Decentralized identifiers</h2>

<p>A decentralized identifier is a globally unique and verifiable digital credential used to identify any subject (e.g. a person, organization, piece of code, etc.).  It is a kind of credential owned by that subject where it cannot revoke by its issuer.</p>

<p>A decentralized identifier is one based on DLT enabled verifiable data registry. A DLT enabled registry is not solely under the control of the issuer and one that is temper-proof. It also uses cryptographic technologies to associate a credential with its owner to ensure the confidence of a credential’s ownership.</p>

<p>In Applied Consentia, we believe that this is the solution to resolve the pain points of identity management. We are committed to offering this solution to you.</p>

<h2 id="how-will-applied-consentia-promote-the-use-of-decentralized-identifiers">How will Applied Consentia promote the use of decentralized identifiers?</h2>

<p>To help you exploit the benefit of a decentralized identifier, we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Research DLT technologies from various open sources (i.e. Hyperledger Indy, etc.) and our partner solutions to assess their suitabilities and license our knowledge to help you strategies an appropriate use case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incubate technologies and license and customize them to support your projects to exploit decentralized identifiers.</p>
